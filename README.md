# 👋 Hi, I'm Sabbir Ahmed Sibli

🎓 **Bioinformatics Researcher | XAI for Structural Biology | Former University Lecturer**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a motivated researcher blending **Computer Science and Biology** to develop explainable, computational tools for biological data analysis. My journey spans across **machine learning**, **bioinformatics**, and **high-performance computing**, with a focus on making AI-driven protein structure predictions more transparent and interpretable.

## 🔬 Current Focus

I'm currently pursuing my **Erasmus Mundus European Master's in Biomedical Engineering** (EMMBIOME) across Serbia, Greece, and Romania. My master's thesis explores:

> _“Enhancing Protein Structure Prediction using XAI Methods - A Novel Approach”_

This project involves:
- Applying DeepSHAP and other explainable AI techniques to AlphaFold2, OpenFold, and ESMFold
- Interpreting predictions to find biologically meaningful residues
- Working with multi-omics data using HPC resources
